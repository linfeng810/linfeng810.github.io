# Introduction

I am a third-year PhD student at Imperial College London. My research project revolves around computational mechanics, finite element method, discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and mesh adaptivity. At earlier stage of this PhD I was modelling fluid-structure interation. Right now I work on implementing DG method in a matrix-free way on GPU. 

Before this PhD I got my Bachelor and Master degreee both in nuclear engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University. During my master I worked on numerical simulation of subcooled boiling and critical heat flux.
